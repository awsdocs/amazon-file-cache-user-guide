# Accessing caches<a name="accessing-caches"></a>

In the following topics, you can learn how to access your cache on a Linux instance\. In addition, you can find how to use the fileÂ `fstab` to automatically remount your cache after any system restarts\.

Before you can mount a cache, you must create, configure, and launch your related AWS resources\. For detailed instructions, see [Getting started with Amazon File Cache](getting-started.md)\. Next, you can install and configure the Lustre client on your compute instance\.
