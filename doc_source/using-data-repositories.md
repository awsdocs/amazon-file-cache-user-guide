# Using data repositories with Amazon File Cache<a name="using-data-repositories"></a>

Amazon File Cache is a fully managed high\-speed cache on AWS that makes it easier to process file data, regardless of where the data is stored\. your cache serves as a temporary, high\-performance storage location, for data stored in on\-premises file systems, AWS file systems, and Amazon S3 buckets\. Using this capability, you can make dispersed data sets available to file\-based applications on AWS with a unified view and at high speedsâ€”sub\-millisecond latencies and high throughput\.
