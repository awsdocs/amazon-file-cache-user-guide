# Front\-end I/O metrics<a name="frontend-io-metrics"></a>

The following metrics report cache\-level information on system read and write operations\. All these metrics take one dimension \(`FileCacheId`\) and are published into the `AWS/FSx` namespace in CloudWatch\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| DataReadBytes |  The number of bytes for cache read operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with read operations during the period\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of bytes associated with read operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of bytes associated with read operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes associated with read operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average throughput \(bytes per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/FileCacheGuide/frontend-io-metrics.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| DataWriteBytes |  The number of bytes for cache write operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with write operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of bytes associated with write operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of bytes associated with write operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes associated with write operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average throughput \(bytes per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/FileCacheGuide/frontend-io-metrics.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| DataReadOperations |  The number of read operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of read operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of read operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of read operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of read operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average number of read operations \(operations per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\.

| DataWriteOperations |  The number of write operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of write operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of write operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number write operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of write operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average number of write operations \(operations per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\.

| MetadataOperations |  The number of metadata operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the count of metadata operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of metadata operations per disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of metadata operations per disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of metadata operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average number of metadata operations \(operations per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\.
