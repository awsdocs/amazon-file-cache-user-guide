# Cache utilization metrics<a name="utilization-metrics"></a>

The following metrics report cache\-level storage information\. These metrics take one dimension \(`FileCacheId`\) and are published into the `AWS/FSx` namespace in CloudWatch\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `FreeDataStorageCapacity` |  The amount of available data storage capacity\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes available in the cache The `Minimum` statistic is the total number bytes available in the fullest disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the total number of bytes available in the disk with the most remaining available storage\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes available per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/FileCacheGuide/utilization-metrics.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| `FreeMetadataStorageCapacity` | The amount of available metadata storage capacity\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes of metadata storage available in the cache\. The `Minimum` statistic is the total number of bytes available in the fullest metadata target \(MDT\) disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the total number of bytes available in the MDT disk with the most remaining storage\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes available per MDT disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of MDT disks\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/FileCacheGuide/utilization-metrics.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  |
