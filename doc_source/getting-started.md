# Getting started with Amazon File Cache<a name="getting-started"></a>

Following, you can learn how to get started using Amazon File Cache\. These steps walk you through creating an Amazon File Cache resource and accessing it from your compute instances\. Amazon File Cache can link to an Amazon S3 or NFS data repository \(but not to both types at the same time\)\. This exercise will use an Amazon S3 bucket as the data repository, and will also show how to use your cache to process the data in your Amazon S3 bucket with your file\-based applications\.

This getting started exercise includes the following steps\.
