# Monitoring Amazon File Cache<a name="monitoring_overview"></a>

You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch Amazon File Cache and report when something is wrong:
+ **Monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch** – CloudWatch collects and processes raw data from Amazon File Cache into readable, near real\-time metrics\. You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state\.
+ **AWS CloudTrail log monitoring** – Share log files between accounts, monitor CloudTrail log files in real time by sending them to CloudWatch Logs, write log processing applications in Java, and validate that your log files have not changed after delivery by CloudTrail\.
